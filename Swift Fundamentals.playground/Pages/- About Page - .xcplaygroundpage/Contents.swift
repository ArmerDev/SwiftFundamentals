/*: # Swift Fundamentals
 
 This playground consists of the fundamentals of the Swift programming language.

 The content found in this playground is from [Paul Hudson's](https://twitter.com/twostraws) 100 Days of SwiftUI course, which can be found at [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)

 Note - some example code is duplicated to show how things can be built upon. However, to ensure there is no errors, things may be renamed to version B. For example, a class of Car may be duplicated and renamed CarB.

 Please ensure that you have Show Rendered Markup enabled to read the playground in the intended way.
 
 To enable, select Editor in the menu bar, then click **Show Rendered Markup**
