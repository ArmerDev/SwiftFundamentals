/*:Swift can create constants and variables, but constants are generally preferable.
Use this to create and then change a variable string:*/
var name = "James"
name = "Luke"
/*:If you don't want to change a value, use a constant instead:*/
let user = "Mike"
/*:The print() function is helpful for learning and debugging, and hows some information about a variable:*/
